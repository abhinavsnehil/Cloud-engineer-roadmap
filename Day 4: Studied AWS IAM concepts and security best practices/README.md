# Day 5 – Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## Topics Covered
- What is EC2
- EC2 instance types
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
- Key pairs
- Security groups
- EC2 lifecycle

## What I Learned
- EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- Instance types are optimized for different use cases
- AMI defines the OS and software configuration
- Key pairs are used for secure login
- Security groups act as virtual firewalls

## EC2 Instance Lifecycle
- Launch
- Running
- Stopped
- Terminated

## Security Concepts
- Security groups allow inbound and outbound traffic
- SSH (port 22) is used for Linux instance access
- HTTP (port 80) is used for web traffic

## Practical Tasks
- Launched a Linux EC2 instance
- Connected to EC2 using SSH
- Configured security group rules
- Stopped and terminated instances

## Key Takeaways
- EC2 is the backbone of most AWS workloads
- Security groups are stateful firewalls
- Proper instance sizing saves cost
