# Day 20 – High Availability and Auto Scaling

## Topics Covered
- High Availability (HA)
- Fault tolerance
- Auto Scaling
- Load Balancing
- Multi-AZ architecture

## High Availability
- Systems remain operational during failures
- Achieved using redundancy and automation

## Fault Tolerance
- Ability to continue functioning after failure
- Uses multiple resources across AZs

## Auto Scaling
- Automatically adjusts capacity
- Scales based on demand
- Improves availability and cost efficiency

## Load Balancing
- Distributes traffic across instances
- Improves performance and reliability
- Example: Application Load Balancer

## Multi-AZ Architecture
- Resources deployed across multiple AZs
- Protects against AZ failure
- Increases reliability

## Practical Example
- ALB + Auto Scaling Group across 2 AZs
- EC2 instances scale based on CPU utilization

## Key Takeaways
- HA improves uptime
- Auto Scaling optimizes cost and performance
