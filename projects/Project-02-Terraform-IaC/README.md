Project 02: Infrastructure as Code using Terraform on AWS

Project Overview:-

This project demonstrates provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform. The goal is to automate infrastructure deployment instead of manually creating resources through AWS Console.

Objectives:-

• Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

• Automate VPC and EC2 provisioning

• Reduce manual configuration errors

• Enable repeatable infrastructure deployment

Resources Provisioned:-

• AWS VPC

• Public Subnet

• Internet Gateway

• Route Table

• Security Group

EC2 Instance

Terraform Workflow:-

terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply

terraform destroy

Security Implementation:-

• HTTP allowed for web access

• Proper network routing configured

Key Learnings:-

• Infrastructure automation

• State management

• Idempotency

• Cloud provisioning best practices
