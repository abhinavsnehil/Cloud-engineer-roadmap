Project 05 – CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions

Overview:-

This project demonstrates how to implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Whenever code is pushed to the main branch, the workflow automatically builds a Docker image and simulates deployment.

Objectives:-

• Automate build process

• Integrate Docker into CI pipeline

• Trigger workflow on code push

• Simulate automated deployment

Tools & Technologies:-

• GitHub Actions

• Docker

• Nginx

• YAML

• Linux (Ubuntu Runner)

Workflow Process:-

• Developer pushes code to main branch

• GitHub Actions triggers workflow

• Docker image is built

• Image verification step runs

• Deployment simulation completes

Key Learnings:-

• CI/CD pipeline structure

• GitHub workflow syntax

• Docker image build automation

• Event-driven DevOps automation

Real-World Use Case:-

Used in:

• SaaS platforms

• E-commerce applications

• Enterprise cloud deployments
